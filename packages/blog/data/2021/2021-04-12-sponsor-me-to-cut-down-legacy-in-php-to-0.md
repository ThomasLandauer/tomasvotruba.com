title: "Sponsor me to Cut Down Legacy in PHP to 0 %"
perex: |
    I've update my GitHub sponsor page after more than least 6 months. There are new cool tiers - a "thank you" tweet, monthly call and couple more. [Go check it](https://github.com/sponsors/TomasVotruba).
    <br><br>
    Yet I had a feeling there should be one more tier - a *vision tear*. Why should you support me as one. You know like "Get a family to Mars by 2030".

I've worked with big e-commerce projects for the past 8 years. Their age was from 10-15 years and my job was  to maintain them, refactor, start sustainable architecture on green-field. Each was in a different field, with different group of people, PHP framework or even country. Yet they had one thing in common - I was removing legacy.

To be specific, I was not removing legacy - my work was not to send pull-request with 0 new line and 50 000 removed lines.
My job was to move lines of code "legacy" pile to a "good code" pile.

- Day 1: 100 % of legacy code, 0 % of good code
- Day 2: 99,5 % of legacy code, 0,5 % of good code, and so on.

It like with money, if you wait and do nothing, the inflation will increase and slow down the value. After a month of vacation, my worked looked like:

- Day 30: 99,8 % of legacy code, 0,2 % of good code, and so on.

The bigger the project is, the more continuous the code quality inflation was. I felt helpless, fighting with wind mills.

    "The code becomes legacy the moment it's written.

You probably know this quote. We've been with legacy so long that we learned to adapt, live with it and make it part of lives. We can never remove it, we can only live with it. That's how we think at least.

The same applies for cancer. I guess the first time doctors discovered cancer, they had no idea what to do with it, what do

Yes, somehow we learn to work with with better everyday and success survival rate grows:

Why? Because we aim at making cancer 1 % less mortal every year? No, because we aim at 0 % cancer in total. We try, we strive the best, the doctors and researches look for a solution. If there would be a discovery of magical DNA modification that achieves the 0 % cancer mortality, would we avoid it, because we reached should go only 1 % percent per year?

No, we're looking for this disruptive innovaiton (@todo see innovatios)

# What is the Higher Vision of our PHP Community?

When we look at [PHP Annotated mothly from PHPSTorm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/category/php-annotated-monthly/), what we see? New tools, new RFC got accepted, new versoin of known frameworks were release.

If there are no releases, there is no legacy code. If we would be using PHP 4, we would not have legacy project that still don't have namespaces (not, they were added in PHP 5.3).

The faster we evolve, the faster code becomes legacy.

<br>

What now?

# 1. Slow Down Evolution?

One of solution is to stop evolving. Look at our planes... there was 5 billions people when I was born. Now it 7.6 and growing. The more peole there is, the more food, animal, plants, houses and clothers we need. The higher consumption of plannet. Should we stop having children for next 30 years? I'm just a PHP developer, not planet-maintainer, but not a way to go probably.

We could see this approach in PHP 5.6-times. Adding scalar types was a huge ~~challange...~~ change that would require lot of manual work in every single existing PHP project. Many RFC voters were part of PH Pcommunity for some time so they could forsee the amount of discruption (not good one) and energy would take to wolrd PH Pcode base to catch up.

I recall some people left the PHP community, just because the innovation was being slowed down for this reason. Thank sfor getting back A faulds!

But now in 2021 we know the slowing down evolution is not an option.

# 2. Accept Legacy

Living with legacy is somethign most developers got used too. "It's ok, it's legacy code, it's historical reasons, that's how we always did it. If it works, don'T change it."

We have books and posts about how not to touch legacy code, how to appreciate and live with it.
In psyhcologc,y they call this "learnt hlepnesnes".

Not a way to go in a long temr.


# 3. Make Legacy 0 %... Again

They same way we strive to make every single person alive through cancer, we must aim at making legacy %

It's possible, we can do it and I'll put my part intothis.

(we are here now: ast)
